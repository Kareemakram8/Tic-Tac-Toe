## 🧠 How It Works

* The game board is generated dynamically using a 2D array.
* Turns are stored in state using `useState()`.
* The active player is derived from the turn history.
* Win conditions are checked using pre-defined 3-in-a-row combinations.
* Game status is updated live with React's reactivity.
